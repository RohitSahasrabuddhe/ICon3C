Guru Gobind Singhji Institute of Engineering and Technology (SGGSIE&amp;T),
Nanded established in 1981 has grown to the level of being recognized as a
leader in the area of technical education and research. Started with just two
undergraduate programs, it now offers 10 undergraduate and 7 postgraduate
programs. It offers Ph. D. program under its affiliating University, Swami
Ramanand Teerth Marathwada (SRTM) University, Nanded and under Quality
Improvement Program of Ministry of HRD, Government of India, New Delhi.
Pragmatic Management of the Institute has taken proactive steps to depute
faculty to various IITs and NITs for higher studies. The faculty not only
acquired higher qualifications but also brought back along with them the
culture of these premier organizations. SGGSIE&amp;T is rich in highly
qualified faculty with more than 50% of the regular faculty being doctorates.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:5.75pt;line-height:12.9pt;vertical-align:

of its inception, the Institute has made a mark in technical education and
quality research which got endorsed by a third party survey constituted by
Government of Maharashtra and headed by Dr. F. C. Kohli, Chairman, TCS. Through
that survey conducted in 2004, SGGSIE&amp;T, Nanded got identified it as an
Institute which can be raised to the level of Centre of Excellence along with
three other well established organizations such as College of Engineering,
Pune; VJTI, Mumbai and ICT, Mumbai.</span></b></p>

Institute has state of the art equipment and machinery for teaching as well as
research / consultancy services. Faculty have contributed in being way for
laboratory development through proposals to various funding agencies like
AICTE, DST, BARC, NRB, etc other than the funding obtained under two phases of
TEQIP and from Government of Maharashtra. Most of the laboratories are kept
open for the students 24 × 7. Four of the institute’s departments have FIST
sponsored laboratories. Faculty research abilities have led to the
establishment of a &quot;Centre of Excellence&quot; in the area of Signal and
Image Processing under TEQIP. Scholarships are made available to the full time
research scholars from Center of Excellence in signal and image processing and
Technical Education Quality Improvement Program of the Ministry of HRD,
Government of India. Sponsored and Joint Research projects with various
organizations such as BRNS and NRB represent other feathers in the cap of this
Institute.</span></b></p>

Institute has a very progressive and pragmatic approach in providing its
services to all its stakeholders. We at SGGSIE&amp;T believe in learning. It is
always our endeavour to provide the students with right environment for
learning. The Institute has collaborations with a number of premier institutes
(including foreign universities) and industries through which opportunities
like internships, credit transfers, industry relevant projects, etc are made
available for the students. The students have also taken due advantage and
performed par excellence. It is exhibited by their placement either in terms of
the numbers or their positions at various renowned industries, acquiring seats
for higher education (so far our students have got AIR 1 four times in GATE),
establishing their own ventures (including MNCs) and even selection in
administrative &amp; engineering services. Our students have exhibited their
overall development through participation in socially relevant projects and
activities. They have even grabbed opportunities of serving the local
administration / government agencies through a process of competitive bidding
also.</span></b></p>

thousands of research contributions with good citation record in peer reviewed
prestigious national / international journals and reputed international

number of books have also been published by the faculty. Patenting is becoming
a promising feature of the institute basically because student projects are
also getting converted into patents. Establishment of Innovation Laboratory and
participation of roughly 15% of the total student strength in various
Innovation projects is a key feature of the institution.</span></b></p>
